# Nginx Main Configuration Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the main Nginx configuration file (nginx.conf), designed for complete beginners.

## What is nginx.conf?

The `nginx.conf` file is the main configuration file for the Nginx web server. It contains global settings that apply to all websites hosted on this server. Think of it as the master control panel that sets up how Nginx works at its core.

## File Structure Explained

The file is organized into several sections, each controlling different aspects of the web server:

```nginx
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;

error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    # HTTP settings here
}
```

Let's break down each section in detail:

## Main Context (Top Level)

### User Setting

```nginx
user nginx;
```

**What it does:** Defines which system user Nginx will run as.

**Detailed explanation:**
- Nginx starts as root but then switches to this user for security
- The "nginx" user typically has limited permissions
- This is a security measure to limit damage if Nginx is compromised
- If this user doesn't exist, Nginx might not start properly

### Worker Processes

```nginx
worker_processes auto;
```

**What it does:** Controls how many worker processes Nginx will create.

**Detailed explanation:**
- Each worker process handles connections independently
- `auto` tells Nginx to create one worker per CPU core
- More workers can handle more simultaneous connections
- Too many workers can waste resources
- For a dedicated server, `auto` is usually the best setting
- For shared hosting, a specific number might be better

### Error Log

```nginx
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
```

**What it does:** Specifies where and what level of errors to log.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `/var/log/nginx/error.log` is the file path where errors are saved
- `notice` is the logging level (from most to least verbose):
  - `debug` - Extremely detailed information
  - `info` - Informational messages
  - `notice` - Normal but significant events
  - `warn` - Warning events
  - `error` - Error events
  - `crit` - Critical events
  - `alert` - Action must be taken immediately
  - `emerg` - System is unusable
- Higher verbosity (like `debug`) generates larger log files
- For production, `error` or `warn` is often sufficient
- For troubleshooting, you might temporarily increase to `debug`

### Process ID

```nginx
pid /var/run/nginx.pid;
```

**What it does:** Specifies where to store the process ID.

**Detailed explanation:**
- The PID file contains the process ID of the main Nginx process
- This file is used by system tools to send signals to Nginx
- For example, when you run `nginx -s reload`, it reads this file to know which process to signal
- The location is standard and rarely needs changing

## Events Context

```nginx
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
```

**What it does:** Controls how Nginx handles connections at a system level.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `worker_connections 1024` - Maximum number of connections each worker process can handle simultaneously
- The total number of connections your server can handle = worker_processes Ã— worker_connections
- For example, with 4 CPU cores and 1024 worker_connections, you can handle up to 4,096 simultaneous connections
- This doesn't mean 4,096 users - each user typically opens multiple connections
- Modern browsers open 6-8 connections per domain to download resources in parallel
- If you see errors about "too many open files", you might need to increase this value and the system's open file limit

## HTTP Context

```nginx
http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    # Security settings
    server_tokens off;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    sendfile on;

    # Rate limiting
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wordpress:10m rate=1r/s;
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=ip_limit:10m rate=5r/m;

    # Log format
    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                    '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

    # Include site configurations
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```

This is the largest and most complex section. Let's break it down:

### MIME Types

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
default_type application/octet-stream;
```

**What it does:** Tells browsers what type of content they're receiving.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `include /etc/nginx/mime.types` - Loads a file that maps file extensions to MIME types
  - For example, `.html` files are mapped to `text/html`
  - This tells browsers how to handle different file types
- `default_type application/octet-stream` - The default MIME type for files with unknown extensions
  - `application/octet-stream` tells browsers to download the file instead of displaying it
  - This is a safe default for unknown file types

### Basic Performance and Security Settings

```nginx
server_tokens off;
keepalive_timeout 65;
sendfile on;
```

**What it does:** Configures basic security and performance options.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `server_tokens off` - Hides the Nginx version number from error pages and HTTP headers
  - This is a security measure to prevent attackers from targeting known vulnerabilities in specific versions
  - It doesn't actually fix vulnerabilities but follows the "security through obscurity" principle
- `keepalive_timeout 65` - How long (in seconds) to keep client connections open
  - Keepalive connections allow multiple requests to use the same connection
  - This saves the overhead of establishing new TCP connections
  - 65 seconds is a good balance between resource usage and performance
  - Too short: More connection overhead
  - Too long: More idle connections consuming resources
- `sendfile on` - Uses the efficient `sendfile()` system call to send files
  - This bypasses user space and sends files directly from the kernel
  - Significantly improves performance when serving static files
  - Almost always should be enabled

### Rate Limiting

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wordpress:10m rate=1r/s;
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=ip_limit:10m rate=5r/m;
```

**What it does:** Protects your site from brute force attacks and excessive requests.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `limit_req_zone` - Defines zones for rate limiting
- `$binary_remote_addr` - Uses the client's IP address as the key (in binary form to save memory)
- First zone: `zone=wordpress:10m rate=1r/s`
  - `zone=wordpress` - Names this zone "wordpress" (used in server blocks)
  - `10m` - Allocates 10 megabytes of memory for storing IP addresses
  - `rate=1r/s` - Limits each IP to 1 request per second
  - This is used for sensitive WordPress endpoints like wp-login.php
- Second zone: `zone=ip_limit:10m rate=5r/m`
  - `zone=ip_limit` - Names this zone "ip_limit"
  - `10m` - Allocates 10 megabytes of memory
  - `rate=5r/m` - Limits each IP to 5 requests per minute
  - This is a very strict limit, typically used for highly sensitive areas

**Note:** These zones only define the limits. They must be applied in location blocks to take effect.

### Logging Configuration

```nginx
log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;
```

**What it does:** Configures what information is logged about each request.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `log_format main '...'` - Defines a format named "main" with various variables:
  - `$remote_addr` - The client's IP address
  - `$remote_user` - The authenticated user (if any)
  - `$time_local` - Local time when the request was received
  - `$request` - The full HTTP request line (e.g., "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1")
  - `$status` - HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500)
  - `$body_bytes_sent` - Number of bytes sent to the client
  - `$http_referer` - The referring page (where the visitor came from)
  - `$http_user_agent` - The client's browser and OS information
  - `$http_x_forwarded_for` - The original client IP if behind a proxy
- `access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main` - Specifies:
  - Where to store access logs (`/var/log/nginx/access.log`)
  - Which format to use (`main`)

### Including Site-Specific Configurations

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
```

**What it does:** Loads all the individual website configurations.

**Detailed explanation:**
- This directive includes all files ending with `.conf` in the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory
- Each file typically contains a server block for a different website
- This modular approach keeps the main configuration clean
- Your `YOUR_DOMAIN.com.conf` file is loaded through this directive
- Changes to these files can be applied without editing the main nginx.conf

## Recommended Additions for Better Performance and Security

The current configuration is good, but could be improved with these additions:

### Buffer Size Settings

```nginx
client_body_buffer_size 10K;
client_header_buffer_size 1k;
client_max_body_size 8m;
large_client_header_buffers 2 1k;
```

**What it would do:** Controls how much memory is allocated for different parts of client requests.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `client_body_buffer_size 10K` - Size of buffer for client request body (like form submissions)
  - If a request body is larger than this, it will be written to a temporary file
  - 10K is sufficient for most forms but may need to be increased for file uploads
- `client_header_buffer_size 1k` - Size of buffer for client request headers
  - 1K is enough for most normal requests
  - If headers don't fit, Nginx will allocate a larger buffer from large_client_header_buffers
- `client_max_body_size 8m` - Maximum allowed size of client request body (limits upload size)
  - Requests larger than this will receive a 413 (Request Entity Too Large) error
  - For WordPress, you might want to increase this to allow larger uploads (e.g., 20m or more)
- `large_client_header_buffers 2 1k` - Number and size of buffers for large client headers
  - "2" is the number of buffers
  - "1k" is the size of each buffer
  - Used for unusually large headers (like cookies or long URLs)

### Timeout Settings

```nginx
client_body_timeout 12;
client_header_timeout 12;
send_timeout 10;
```

**What it would do:** Sets various timeout values to protect against slow clients.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `client_body_timeout 12` - How long (in seconds) to wait between receiving body packets
  - If the client doesn't send anything for 12 seconds during body transmission, the connection is closed
  - Protects against slow POST attacks
- `client_header_timeout 12` - How long to wait between receiving header packets
  - If the client doesn't send the complete headers within 12 seconds, the connection is closed
  - Protects against slow header attacks
- `send_timeout 10` - How long to wait between client reads of response
  - If the client doesn't read any data for 10 seconds, the connection is closed
  - Prevents clients from keeping connections open without reading data

### Gzip Compression

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_min_length 10240;
gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml application/json;
gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";
```

**What it would do:** Compresses responses to reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `gzip on` - Enables gzip compression
  - Compresses text-based content before sending it to the client
  - Can reduce bandwidth usage by 50-70% for text files
- `gzip_vary on` - Adds "Vary: Accept-Encoding" header
  - Tells proxies that the content varies based on the Accept-Encoding header
  - Important for caching compressed and uncompressed versions correctly
- `gzip_min_length 10240` - Only compress responses larger than 10KB
  - Very small files might actually become larger when compressed
  - The overhead of compression isn't worth it for small files
- `gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth` - When to compress responses to proxies
  - Compresses responses with these cache-control headers
  - Helps ensure proper caching behavior
- `gzip_types text/plain text/css...` - MIME types to compress
  - Lists all the content types that should be compressed
  - Text-based formats benefit most from compression
- `gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\."` - Disables compression for old Internet Explorer versions
  - These old browsers had bugs with compressed content
  - Modern browsers don't have these issues

### TCP Optimizations

```nginx
tcp_nopush on;
tcp_nodelay on;
```

**What it would do:** Optimizes TCP packet handling for better performance.

**Detailed explanation:**
- `tcp_nopush on` - Enables TCP_CORK socket option
  - Allows Nginx to send HTTP response headers in one packet
  - Optimizes the amount of data sent in each packet
  - Works best with sendfile on
- `tcp_nodelay on` - Enables TCP_NODELAY socket option
  - Disables Nagle's algorithm, which buffers small packets
  - Reduces latency by sending data immediately
  - Particularly beneficial for interactive applications
- These settings might seem contradictory, but they work well together:
  - tcp_nopush optimizes the number of packets
  - tcp_nodelay ensures packets are sent without delay once they're full

## How to Apply These Improvements

To add these recommended settings to your nginx.conf, you would insert them in the http context:

```nginx
http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    # Performance optimizations
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    
    # Buffer size settings
    client_body_buffer_size 10K;
    client_header_buffer_size 1k;
    client_max_body_size 8m;
    large_client_header_buffers 2 1k;
    
    # Timeout settings
    client_body_timeout 12;
    client_header_timeout 12;
    send_timeout 10;
    keepalive_timeout 65;

    # Gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_min_length 10240;
    gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml application/json;
    gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";

    # Security settings
    server_tokens off;

    # Rate limiting
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wordpress:10m rate=1r/s;
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=ip_limit:10m rate=5r/m;
    
    # Log format
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

    # Include site configurations
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```

## Testing and Applying Changes

After making changes to nginx.conf, always test the configuration before applying it:

```bash
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -t
```

This command checks the syntax of your configuration files. If it reports "syntax is ok" and "test is successful", you can safely reload Nginx:

```bash
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

This reloads the configuration without stopping the server or dropping connections.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Checking Nginx Status

To see if Nginx is running:

```bash
docker-compose ps nginx
```

### Viewing Logs

To view the last 100 lines of the error log:

```bash
docker-compose exec nginx tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

To view the access log in real-time:

```bash
docker-compose exec nginx tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Address already in use" error:**
   - Another service is using port 80 or 443
   - Solution: Stop the other service or change Nginx's ports

2. **"Permission denied" errors:**
   - Nginx can't read or write to certain files
   - Solution: Check file permissions and ownership

3. **High CPU or memory usage:**
   - Too many worker processes or connections
   - Solution: Adjust worker_processes and worker_connections

4. **Slow response times:**
   - Missing performance optimizations
   - Solution: Enable gzip, sendfile, and other optimizations
